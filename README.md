## What is **dreddshift**
dreddshift is (or at least intended to eventually be) a collection of views and utilities for administrating Redshift, in the vein of the suite of tools for Redshift created by AWS.

## Why am I litering github with more redundant code?!
Similar tools have been written before by lots of other people. But triangulation is a hard problem to solve, and I often can write the thing I want faster than I can find, grok, and tweak an existing piece of code to my liking. So here we are. 

I really hope you like it, and if you don't, ~keep it to yourself~ leave an issue! I don't check my github notifications very often, but if you really want me to see your suggestions, please find me in either intermixio.slack.com or getdbt.slack.com where I am somewhat active. 


## Why Redshift? It's so unhip!
Well, in my defense, it's hipper than Oracle, SQL Server, and Vertica. That being said, if you're wondering why I bothered writing these tools when Snowflake exists... so am I. A Snowflake repo will come some day. 

Maybe. 

Or not. 

I'm not habitually a punctual person.

Anyway, I'm starting to feel a little more upbeat about Redshift! 2020-2021 had a lot of great updates for Redshift, and it doesn't seem like the pace of progress is going to slow significantly any time soon. So if you're reading this and considering switching to Snowflake, maybe hold off for a little longer, see what happens. 

If you were expecting more out of this README, pay me! Or... look for the other readmes in each folder in this free repo. Your choice. Your money is not no good here. Unless it's counterfeit, stolen, or otherwise in violation of some law, custom, or cultural/religions tradition.
